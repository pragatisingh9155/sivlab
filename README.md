🔬 Smart Interactive Virtual Lab (SIVLab)

SIVLab is a gamified, web-based virtual laboratory designed for engineering students to perform core electronics experiments in an interactive and engaging environment. 
It allows students to practice concepts like logic gates and network theorems through a quiz-based system without the need for physical components.
